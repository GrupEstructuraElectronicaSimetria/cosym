    "`shape` is the script used to calculate continuous shape measures (CShMs) for geometrical objects described as a set of vertices. In this case, we don't compare a given structure with its images obtained after applying a geometrical transformation (proper or improper rotations), but with a reference shape, that is, an ideal polyhedron. In shape we distinguish between centered and non centered polyhedra, depending on if we have a central atom or not in our structure. You can use shape to calculate CShM measures with respect to predefined shapes just by indicating a label, for instance T-4 for the tetrahedron, or with respect to a custom reference structure. In the latter case you must provide a file with the coordinates of your reference structure. \n",

In the `S_coord_9.xyz` file we provide you with the structures of the coordinatton environement for of an europium atom in eight different complexes. Use this information to find which ideal polyhedron is the best description of the coordination environment in each compound and how far is the real geometry from the ideal one in each case. These compounds have their main application as luminiscent materials due to the sharp emission lines originating from f-f transitions on the lanthanide ion. Since f-f transitions are symmetry forbidden in centrosymmetric environements, it's interesting to work with compounds where the coordination environment of Eu is far from having Ci symmetry, a feature that we can check by computing the S(Ci) measure. \n",
