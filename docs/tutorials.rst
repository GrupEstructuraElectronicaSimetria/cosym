Tutorials
=========

Slides and notebooks used in the course "Symmetry & Shape in Structural Chemistry"
given by P. Alemany at the Universidad de Santiago de Chile (USACH) from 5-9 June 2023.

The notebooks and the associated data files give an overview of the main uses of
the *cosymlib*. They can be run directly on *Google colab* without the need of installing
locally the *cosymlib* in the user's computer. If the *cosymlib* is installed in the user's computer,
the notebooks can be also run locally or, alternatively, the commands included in them may
be directly executed, without the need of the notebook. For a routine calculation of CSMs & CShMs
we recommend to download and install the *cosymlib* in your computer and run the scripts
directly, without the need of using notebooks.
