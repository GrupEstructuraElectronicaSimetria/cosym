Introduction
============

**Cosymlib** is a python library for computing continuous symmetry & shape measures (CSMs & CShMs).
Although most of the tools included in **cosymlib** have been devised especially with the purpose of
analyzing the symmetry & shape of molecules as proposed initially by D. Avnir and coworkers [Avnir]_
many of the procedures contained in **cosymlib** can be easily applied to
any finite geometrical object defined by a set of vertices or a by mass distribution function.
