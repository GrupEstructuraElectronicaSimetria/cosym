**Cosymlib** is a python library for computing continuous symmetry & shape measures (CSMs & CShMs).
Although its main aim is to provide simple and ready-to-use tools for the analysis of the symmetry &
shape of molecules, many of the procedures contained in **cosymlib** can be easily applied to
any finite geometrical object defined by a set of vertices or a by mass distribution function.

The basic tasks included in the current version of **cosymlib** are:

1. **Molecular structure analysis**

    * Calculation of Continuous Shape Measures (CShMs)
    * Calculation of Continuous Symmetry Measures (CSMs)
    * Calculation of Continuous Chirality Measures (CCM)

2. **Electronic structure analysis**

    * Pseudosymmetry analysis of molecular orbitals & wavefunctions
    * Continuous Symmetry & Chirality Measures for the molecular electron density

**Cosymlib** is being developed by the **Electronic Structure & Symmetry (ESS)** group
at the Department de Ciència de Material i Química Física
and the Institut de Química Teòrica i Computacional (IQTCUB). University of Barcelona.
